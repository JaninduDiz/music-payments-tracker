## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A050BE) inspired by Apple Music's branding and a sense of modern technology. This is brighter to be visible on a dark scheme.
- Background color: Dark grey (#282A3A), desaturated from the primary purple to give a modern, sleek feel, complementing iOS dark mode.
- Accent color: Pink (#E91E63), a color that stands out against the purple and grey, drawing the eye and creating emphasis. Pink sits between purple and red on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif offering a modern, machined, neutral look suitable for clear and accessible text.
- Use clean, minimalist vector icons in white for clarity against the dark background.
- Employ iOS-style tab navigation for 'Members,' 'Payments,' and 'Balance' views, ensuring a familiar user experience.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and interactions, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
